/-! Finite-dimensional overlap analysis. No spacetime or field-equation claims.
The local constant real trace is explicit; for a continuous family of finite
idempotents it follows from local constancy of integer-valued rank (written proof).
The principal theorem needs only entrywise differentiability at the base point.
